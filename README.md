# TestLibSignalsSlots

I want to receive signals from instances of classes defined in dynamically loaded libraries.

I receive signals from the main plugin class instance but not from an instance of another class in the library

If someone has a solution, he can send a pull request to make this project a complete example to build a Qt project with libraries with signals and slots
